# extendedcommands
A mod that adds more commands to Wurm Unlimited (work in progress)

/wildlife
Typing this command in any chat window will display total creatures, number of friendly, aggressive, and unique creatures count for any player.  This was inspired from our server when the players were asking how many uniques were on the map.
